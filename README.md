## 🧩 Game Overview

In **Guess-O-Matic**, both players secretly set a numeric code of a chosen length (e.g., 4, 5, or 6 digits).  
Players then take alternate turns guessing the opponent’s code.  
After each guess, you’ll receive **position-based feedback** that tells you which digits are correct and in the correct position.

Keep refining your guesses, think strategically, and race to decode your rival’s secret before they crack yours! ⚔️
